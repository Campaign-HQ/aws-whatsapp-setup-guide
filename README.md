## 1. Setting Up a WhatsApp Phone Number

> **Note:** If you already have a WhatsApp number connected, you may skip this section.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to **AWS Console** → **Social Messaging** → **WhatsApp Business Accounts**.
2. Click **"Add WhatsApp phone number"** (top-right corner).
3. On the new page, click **"Launch Facebook portal"**.
4. A Facebook embedded flow popup will open. Follow the instructions to:
   - Create or choose a Meta Business Account.
   - Verify the phone number (**must not be already connected to WhatsApp**).
   - Optionally, you may use a Meta-provided US phone number.
5. After completing the flow, return to the AWS Console and click **"Add phone number"**.

### Details to Note for CampaignHQ Integration:

- **Meta Business Account ID** (e.g., `576061365581481`)
- **Phone Number** (e.g., `+1 555-704-7011`)
- **Phone Number ID** (e.g., `phone-number-id-ae5d420295b14bbb9b5f6a23865503a4`)

## 2. Creating an IAM User for WhatsApp Messaging

### A. Create a Custom IAM Policy

1. Go to **IAM** → **Policies** → **Create policy**.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CampaignHQ",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "social-messaging:SendWhatsAppMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:social-messaging:*:{{aws_account_id}}:phone-number-id/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Replace `{{aws_account_id}}` with your actual AWS Account ID (visible in the top-right corner of the AWS Console).

3. Click **Next**, give the policy a name (e.g., `CampaignHQWhatsAppPolicy`), and create it.

### B. Create the IAM User

1. Go to **IAM** → **Users** → **Add user**.
2. Enter a username (e.g., `campaignhq-whatsapp`).
3. Uncheck **AWS Management Console access**.
4. Proceed to **Permissions** → **Attach policies directly** → Select the policy created above.
5. Complete the user creation process.

### C. Generate Access Keys

1. Open the newly created user and go to the **Security credentials** tab.
2. Under **Access keys**, click **Create access key**.
3. For use case, select **Third-party service**, then click **Next**.
4. Optionally add a description → Click **Create access key**.

## 4. Meta App Setup for Template Management

To enable CampaignHQ to manage WhatsApp message templates through their platform, a Meta app needs to be linked to your business account.

### Requirements:

- Admin access to your **Meta Business Account**
- Admin access to your **Meta Developer Account**

A representative from CampaignHQ will assist and guide you through this setup. You can schedule the call here - [Schedule Call](https://www.campaignhq.co/schedule-demo/)
